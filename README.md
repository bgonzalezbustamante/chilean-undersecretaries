## Store and Backup

The GitHub repository has controlled access with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with one physical USB security device and a mobile application. Both issue one-time passwords to generate a cryptographic authentication FIDO 2 and U2F.

Moreover, the repository is backed up on Hierarchical File Server (HFS) for recovery in case of incidents. This backup is located on the University of Oxford hub connected to Code42 Cloud Backup encrypted with 256-bit AES. The backup is performed with every release on GitHub and receives weekly light maintenance and a deep one every month. This backup will be secured until May 2024. An extension of this period will be evaluated on budget availability.
